# Design-and-Analysis-of-algoritms

I worked with two datasets: "Products" and "Customers." The "Products"
dataset had 25,118 product names and prices, while the "Customers" dataset had 36 customer
names. I focused on sorting and searching this data. My program has a menu that allows
users to perform actions such as sorting and searching using algorithms such as QuickSort,
MergeSort, Linear Search, and Radix Sort.
